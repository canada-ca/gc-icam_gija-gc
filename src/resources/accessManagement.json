In the future, other elements may play a role in the authentication process (e.g., user behavioral patterns).</p><p>As with identities and credentials, there are four levels of assurance associated with the authentication process as defined in the Guideline on Defining Authentication Requirements.

Authorization is typically based on static permissions assigned to the subject or dynamic rules governing the overall system.</p><p>Authorization is typically based on one (or more) of four models:<ul><li>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</li><li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</li><li>Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)</li><li>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</li></ul></p><p>Note that these models are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  For example, Gartner recommends a combination of RBAC and ABAC to meet the complex requirements typically associated with implementing authorization solutions.</p><p>The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) specification describes a comprehensive ABAC model that consists of a number of components including Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) which control access to resources (servers, applications, data); and one or more Policy Decision Points (PDP) which render \u201cauthorization decisions\u201d based on requests originating from the PEPs. In today's digital service delivery environment, authorization decisions are typically made locally (i.e., each application is responsible for making authorization decisions for their own resources) so the PEP and PDP tend to be co-located in practice.  However, the XACML model also makes it possible to centralize authorization decisions in much the same way that authentication is being centralized through federation (see Section 3.2.1 in document) which allows for greater flexibility in the future.  In addition, a JSON profile has been defined which provides a simpler, RESTful method for implementing the XACML requests/responses between PEPs and PDPs. Furthermore, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Zero Trust Architecture publication</em></a> (NIST SP 800-207) embraces the XACML model and this is something the GC is investigating as part of its Zero Trust security initiative.</p>",
