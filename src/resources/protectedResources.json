The GC will have its own API store to be accessed by other departments and the public, and the GC will also access external information from public APIs provided by other organizations. In order to access GC APIs, users and applications will often need to authenticate and be authorized to view or modify data available over the API using secure mechanisms.</p><p>Cloud providers also use ICAM APIs for securely controlling access to services. With these, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which resources users and applications can access.</p>"

Mechanisms for authentication vary and can include passwords, PINs, biometrics (e.g., face or fingerprint) as well as MFA. In the best cases a TPM (trusted platform module) is available on the device to allow it to relay the user authentication that was performed to the device to other endpoints.</p><p>Devices come in many flavours of operating system, capabilities, versions, so obtaining a consistent level of ICAM security across many disparate devices can be a challenge.</p>"

In particular, the authoritative sources, identity management systems, and credential management systems must be interoperable across LACS and PACS.</p>"
