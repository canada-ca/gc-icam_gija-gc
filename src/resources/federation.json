        "detail": "<p>A Centralized Authentication/SSO broker component enables organizations to connect multiple service providers with different identity providers (IdP), while also providing a single sign-on (SSO) capability to end users. This facilitates the trust relationship with identity providers and simplifies how service providers can use existing trusted digital identities, rather than creating their own (the silo problem of identity). This also provides a common user interface which improves and unifies the user experience.</p><p>The GC supports external and internal centralized authentication/SSO brokers based on the Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect protocols to enable federation with both external and internal entities. These protocols support the ability for relying parties to specify the LoAs required for the associated user authentication process. The GC deployment profiles for external federation are available on Github (see <a href=\"https://github.com/canada-ca/CATS-STAE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CATS</em></a>) and the GC deployment profiles for internal federation are available on GCpedia (see <a href=\"https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GCpass_-_the_GC_Internal_Centralized_Authentication_Service_(ICAS)#Deployment_Profiles\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GCpass deployment profiles</em></a>). High-level examples of how these protocols work are provided in Appendix A.</p><p>Note that although federation allows credentials issued by a credential provider in one domain to be recognized in other domains, it is important to recognize that it may not always be possible to federate. This could be due to a number of reasons including user choice (e.g., the user does not want to use their existing credentials - such as banking credentials - to access other services), the trust framework in one domain may be incompatible with another domain, the number of domains may become unmanageable, etc. Therefore, it is essential to be able to provide a universal self-serve credential to ensure all users have access to the applications/services they need and the applications/services do not need to manage their own separate credential solutions (also preventing the need for users to re-enroll across multiple applications). To meet internal needs, the universal self-serve credential will be supported by GCpass. GCKey is the universal self-service credential for external users.</p>"

Bring your own identity (BYOI) and social media login are examples of this and could be used in situations such as managing lower assurance requirements such as booking a campground site.</p>"
