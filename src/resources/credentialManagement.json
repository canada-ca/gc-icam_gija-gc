A CSP may be an independent third party, or may issue credentials for its own use.\u201d Note that the credential issued by the CSP binds the identity of the subscriber to the associated authenticator. CSPs are responsible for the life cycle management of these credentials/authenticators over time (see Section 3.1.2.3 in the document).</p><p>For external requirements, the GC currently accepts several different sources of credentials including a number of financial institutions, provincially supplied credentials (currently Alberta and British Columbia only) and a GC branded credential known as GCKey. These credentials are supported by the external GC federation services and users are able to select their preferred credential to access GC on-line services. Although some departments continue to maintain their own legacy credentials, they are encouraged to transition to the GC external federation services wherever possible and all new deployments should include this as a mandatory requirement.</p><p>For internal requirements, there are a number of sources that provide credentials including the Internal Credential Management (ICM) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), departmental PKIs, consolidated SSC and departmental Active Directories, and various other sources including those that are maintained by individual applications/services.</p><p>Note that PKI is a fundamental building block of a modern credential architecture. PKI can be used to establish and life cycle manage credentials for both users as well as NPEs such as devices and applications.  In addition, PKI can be used to support several security services such as binding an identity to a credential, encryption, digital signatures as well as authentication.</p><p>Furthermore, the GC has recently launched an internal federation service referred to as GCpass which is a centralized authentication/SSO broker that will also be capable of issuing credentials to internal users in the future as discussed under Section 3.2.1.1 in the document. Any existing or new enterprise applications/services should use the GCpass internal federation service.</p>",
