Essentially, someone in an administrator role (e.g., a system administrator) can assign a subset of less critical administrative functions to someone else, typically someone that is better suited to carry out the task(s).  For example, an administrator could assign responsibility for managing the profiles of a group of employees to their supervisor.  Delegated administration can also be used to facilitate delegation of authority (i.e., a manager with a certain set of authorities could assign a subset or all of those authorities to others).  This results in greater efficiencies, reduces the workload on the system administrators, supports business continuity, and is key to scalability in a large organization such as the GC. </p>",
