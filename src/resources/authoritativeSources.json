Directories have the advantage of being widely accessible and can be used to publish authoritative attributes from other sources and can also be the authoritative source for certain attributes such as credentials and certain identity attributes.</p><p>Inventory systems keep track of which components are valid for certain purposes. For example, an inventory of all an organization's devices should be part of a Zero Trust architecture, so that it is possible to restrict access only to devices that have been suitably approved and are known to the organization.</p>"

In addition, a number of GC departments (e.g., RCMP, Health Canada) need to share access to GC data with other levels of government, thus requiring authentication of users and trusted access control decisions that rely on authoritative sources from other levels of government.</p><p>User experience and security can be enhanced by leveraging already-established trusted digital identities from other levels of government.</p>"

However, it should be noted that industry identity sources may not always be as strong as foundational government sources, but nevertheless could be used as supporting sources to augment cases where the government sources are not sufficient.</p>"
